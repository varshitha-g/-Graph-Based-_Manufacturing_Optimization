# -Graph-Based-_Manufacturing_Optimization
This project models a manufacturing workflow as a directed graph using Python and NetworkX. It analyzes bottlenecks, simulates machine failures, and optimizes workflows using graph algorithms like shortest path, betweenness centrality, and minimum spanning tree.
