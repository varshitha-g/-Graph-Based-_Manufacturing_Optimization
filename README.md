# Graph-Based_Manufacturing_Optimization
This project demonstrates how to model, analyze, and optimize a manufacturing workflow using graph data science techniques. The manufacturing process is represented as a directed graph, with machines as nodes and process flows as edges. Key insights such as bottleneck identification, failure simulation, and workflow optimization are derived using Python and NetworkX.

## Features:
Graph Modeling:

Machines (nodes) and workflows (edges) with attributes like processing time and failure rates.

### 1. Graph Algorithms:
Bottleneck identification using betweenness centrality.

Path optimization with shortest path algorithms.

Workflow optimization using minimum spanning tree.

### 2. Failure Simulation:
Predicts alternative routes in case of machine failure.

### 3. Visualization:
Visualizes the manufacturing workflow and results using Matplotlib.

## Technologies Used:
Python: For data processing and graph modeling.

NetworkX: For graph creation and analysis.

Matplotlib: For graph visualization.

## Usage:
### Clone the repository:
git clone 

        https://github.com/your-username/graph-based-manufacturing-optimization.
        gitcd graph-based-manufacturing-optimization

## Install dependencies:
        pip install networkx matplotlib

Run the script to analyze and visualize the manufacturing process.

##  Results:
1. Identifies critical bottlenecks in the workflow.
2. Suggests optimized paths to minimize processing time.
3. Provides alternative routes to ensure fault tolerance during machine failure.

## Project Goals:
This project aims to showcase the practical application of graph data science techniques to enhance operational efficiency in manufacturing environments.
